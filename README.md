# Stock Market Analysis Tool

## Overview
The **Stock Market Analysis Tool** is a Python-based desktop application designed to help you dive deep into the world of stock market analysis. Built with **Tkinter** for a clean graphical interface, the tool allows you to easily analyze stock data, calculate moving averages, and visualize trends in stock prices. By using powerful libraries like **pandas** for data manipulation and **matplotlib** for charting, this tool gives you the ability to explore stock performance over time, compare trends, and even export results to CSV for further analysis or record-keeping.

## Features
- **Stock Data Fetching**: Quickly fetch historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance, making it easy to access the most up-to-date market information.
- **Moving Average Calculation**: Calculate and visualize moving averages for any stock’s price, helping to identify long-term trends and potential price patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize stock price movements and the calculated moving averages with interactive **matplotlib** charts. Get a clear, graphical representation of stock performance.
- **Export Results**: Easily save the results of your analysis, including stock data and moving averages, to a CSV file for offline reference or future analysis.
- **Interactive Interface**: The intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface built with **Tkinter** allows for quick input of stock tickers, start and end dates, and moving average windows—no complex setup required.
